<h1>Project Title</h1>
Server-side: Registration and Login Implementation

<h1>Project Description</h1>
This is the Server-side of my Registration and Login Application. I used a database to securely store User's registration details.
<br>
Error Handling and Validation are properly carried out to wholly eradicate server-side or database manipulation.
<br>
<br>
I used NodeJS/Express for the backend.

<h1>Setup</h1>

<br>
If required, you would need to create a .env file in the root of the project directory and add the database link in my .env

Finally, type `npm start` to get the Server started.
<br>
Thank you
