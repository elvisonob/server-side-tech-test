<h1>Project Title</h1>
Server-side: Register and Login Implementation

<h1>Project Description</h1>
This is the Server-side application of my Register and Login Application. I used a database to securely store User's registration details.
<br>
Error Handling and Validation are properly carried out to wholly mitigate against server-side or database manipulation.
<br>
Users can view the list of registered members, assuring them that they can verify the veracity of their own registration details.
<br>
<br>
I used the NodeJS/Express for the backend.
